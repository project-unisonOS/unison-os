# Security

This repository defines the base container image for UnisonOS services.

For overall security and hardening guidance (including how to run UnisonOS services on trusted hardware and networks), see:

- https://project-unisonos.github.io/reference/security/

If you believe you have found a security issue in the base image, please follow the responsible disclosure guidance in the UnisonOS security docs or open a private security advisory on GitHub instead of filing a public issue.
